# Veracode-DevSecOps
Automations to include security into various DevOps Pipelines

---

In this repository, I'm sharing some useful examples how to integrate security scans into development pipelines using enterprises and leader Application Security Vendors like: *Veracode and Aqua Security*.

Here we can have differents automations that analyse our code like:
* SAST - Static Security Application Testing
* SCA - Software Composition Analysis
* Container Image scanning
* IaC scanning

With these examples, it's very easy and helpful to test and quickly deploy security in our development cycle. These scripts are based on my experience of studying and mainly talking with customers
